# LSTM Next Word Prediction Project

### Description
This project demonstrates how to build a Next Word Prediction model using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The model is trained on Shakespeare's *Hamlet*, learning to predict the next word in a sequence. This project is a great hands-on introduction for beginners interested in learning how LSTMs work and how they can be applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

### Features
- Use of *Hamlet* from the NLTK Gutenberg corpus as training data.
- Tokenization and n-gram sequence generation for training.
- Model training using a Bidirectional LSTM network for better context understanding.
- One-hot encoding of labels and embedding layers for word vectors.
- Ability to predict the next word in a given sequence.
- Save and load trained models and tokenizers for future use.
